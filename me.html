<p>
My name is Deepak Yadav. I am from Kathmandu,Nepal. I am 23 years old and currently pursuring Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology at SRM Institute of Science and Technology,Chennai.

I look forward to learn new skills and improve my knowledge to advance my carrer. I am passionate about my work because I love what I do and I have a good source of motivation inside myself that drives me to do my best. I thrive on  challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive twoards.
<br>
Some of my favorite things to do are playing cricket, watching movies
			listen to music, and go for long drives.
			These are activities that I enjoy immensely and indulge in daily.
			My career aspiration is to become a sucessful and hardworking
			engineer. I have been told that I am a charming, kind, attitude-prone 
			person with "oddities". I look up mostly to my family members, especially
			my mom, as a guiding figure in life.</p>

<h3>Academic Projects</h3>
I have done three differnt projects during my course of Engineering. The first one was Hostel Booking Appliaction where the users could book the hostel room by checking their availability and charges for the accomondation. The second one was the Online Banking Application where the users had to open the account and then the users could deposit the money,withdraw the money from their account,check the balance of their account and transfer the money to other's account.
The third project was Home Automation Using IR and GSM Module. In this project, the user can make the control of the equipment and appliances run easily by the use of internet and networking concept using IOT. This project based on GSM and IR provides enhanced security as whenever a signal from sensor occurs, a text message is sent to the desired number to take the necessary actions.
